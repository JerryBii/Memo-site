        Ayrton Francisco unfortunately passed on November 29th, 2020.
        Ayrton was born on December 06, 2001 at Saint Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg.
        His childhood was spent with his family travelling to California and once to Philippines,
        road trips with the extended family, and his close-knit group of friends – swimming, hanging out in the
        neighborhood and playing online games.
        His stylish and sharp fashion sense always lit up the room.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        Ayrton attended École Guyot followed by Collège Beliveau where he graduated with honors in 2019.
        He continued his studies arriving to 2nd year pursuing a bachelor’s in nursing at the University of Saint
        Boniface.
        He will be remembered as an accomplished student as he was a high achieving individual and a musician as he
        played piano and guitar.
        Friends and colleagues considered Ayrton as one of the kindest and most polite individual they’ve ever met.
        To his family, he is the heart and soul. He had so much more to give to those who were already part his life and
        people he had yet to meet.
        A very loving and caring son and to all a dearest friend. Losing him is beyond measure.
