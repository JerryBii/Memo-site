This website was created as a first time project in memory of my dear friend Ayrton Francisco.
I felt an obligation to create something when I was dealing with his passing and this is the result.

It is a demonstration of skill with introductory HTML, and CSS.
Many elements are created as a result of the w3schools CSS sheet.
Many methods use may not be the most efficient, however as it stands it is more than functional

In terms of extended development I wish to find a method to introduce a message board.
As well as a built in method to contact me.
Lastly,general Improvements and general optimizations for the site are in order.

The live site can be found here: https://remember-ayrton.netlify.app/
